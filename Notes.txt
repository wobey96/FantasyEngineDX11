DirectX 11 & Rendering Engine Architecture notes 

Section 1: Intro to Window Ceation
- None really pretty straight forward I like the code quality

Section 2: Intro to D3D Notes

Graphics API Generally Work:
- Give some definitions about a component to the API (definition like XXInfo in Vulkan)
- Create related entitiy for it 
- Help the API to send it to the GPU (Way more complicated in vulkan with synchronization stuff)
- Draw the object to the frame 
- Present the frame 
- Move to the next frame 
- Repeat the process

Initial Components of D3D11
- ID3D11Device: primary management interface to manage D3D assets
- ID3D11DeviceContext: Primary command interface 
- IDXGISwapChain: Primary Interface to present frames to screen 
- ID3D11RenderTargetView: Represents a render target, aka our canvas to paint 
- ID3DBlob: Data store unit. Holds the related data for shaders
- ID3D11VertexShader: program that processes the verticies in the graphics pipeline 
- ID3D11PixelShader: program that tprocesses pixels in the graphics pipeline
- ID3D11Buffer: represents buffer resource, block of memory, various purposes (stor vertex, indext, or const data)
- ID3D11Texture2D: represents a 2D texture resource, various purposes (store image data, render target)
- ID3D11ShaderResourceView: Represents a view of a resource, allowing shaders to access the data in the resource. 
							In the case of textures, used to bind textures to shaders 

How to draw a mesh: 
- Define Vertex Data - create structs to hold vertex data(positions, color, etc...)
- Create Vertex Buffer - alloc memory and upload vertex data to a vertex buffer
- Shader Setup - create vertex and pixel shader for processing vertices and coloring pixels
- Set input layout - define format of the vertex data in the input assembler stage
- create index buffer (Opotional) - if using indexed rendering, create index buffer for efficient storage and rendering 
- Set Vertex and Index Buffer - bind the vertex and index buffers to the input assembler stage 
- Set Shaders - bind vertex and pixel shaders to the pipeline 
- Render - issue draw calls to render the mesh using the specific shaders and buffers
- Present - Display the rendered frame on the screen 

Shader Notes:
- drawing order in vertex shader (clockwise or counter clockwise)
- viewport x, y (0,0 middle), x: -1, 1 y: -1, 1
Vertex shader: SV_POSITION for synchronizing between cpu data and gpu data
Pixel Shader: SV_TARGET specify target (render target)
