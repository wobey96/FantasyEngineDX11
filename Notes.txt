DirectX 11 & Rendering Engine Architecture notes 

Section 1: Intro to Window Ceation
- None really pretty straight forward I like the code quality

Section 2: Intro to D3D Notes

Graphics API Generally Work:
- Give some definitions about a component to the API (definition like XXInfo in Vulkan)
- Create related entitiy for it 
- Help the API to send it to the GPU (Way more complicated in vulkan with synchronization stuff)
- Draw the object to the frame 
- Present the frame 
- Move to the next frame 
- Repeat the process
